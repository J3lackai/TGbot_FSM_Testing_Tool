# TGbot_FSM_Testing_Tool
This repository presents a Python-based pet-project focused on the end-to-end conformance testing of Telegram bots using Finite State Machine (FSM) models. The core objective is to verify whether a Telegram botâ€™s actual interactive behavior aligns with its formally defined FSM specification.
